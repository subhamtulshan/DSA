You are given an integer array nums and an integer x. In one operation, 
you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array nums and subtract its value from x. 
Note that this modifies the array for future operations.
Return the minimum number of operations to reduce x to exactly 0 if it is possible, otherwise, return -1.

solution -- main thing is that we need to find a max subarray such tha sum is total-x

       This question is the equivalent of asking: What's the length of the longest subarray that adds up to the total sum
       of all elements in the array, minus x? Let's say this subarray adds up to the variable target.
       
       Once we've got the answer to that question in a variable res, we can answer the original question by 
       subtracting the resulting length from the total length of the array, since that's the number of 
       operations we'd need to perform to produce the subarray, or nums.length - res.

                    where the first a elements and the last nums.length - i elements are excluded.

                    arrays are zero-indexed. Thus, in my map, I need to store - 1 so that the subtraction i - a
                    evaluates to i + 1. This is why we made a map.put(0, -1) call earlier.
