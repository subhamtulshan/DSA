Description
Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Solution -- Here the idea is that we calculat an abs diff and if the target is greater then currect root then we can 
find a value closer to it only on right else as the right has higher value then currentnode on left.
